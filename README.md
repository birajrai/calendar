# Calendar

A simple, ad-free Nepali calendar with public holidays. This open-source project is for personal or organizational use (commercial resale is prohibited). Check out our roadmap for upcoming features.

We have also introduced a basic API for date conversion and to get the current date in AD or BS. The available endpoints are:

- `/api/convert/ad-bs/YYYY-MM-DD` to convert a date from AD to BS.
- `/api/convert/bs-ad/YYYY-MM-DD` to convert a date from BS to AD.
- To get today's date, you can simply use "today" in the endpoint `/api/convert/ad-bs/today`.
